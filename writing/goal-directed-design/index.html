         <h2>Evaluating Cooper&#39;s Goal Directed Design</h2>
         <p>Steve Jobs suggested that the key to successful software is user experience. He states (2011:01.53.04”)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of the things that I have always found is, that, you have got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology&hellip;we have tried to come up with a <strong>strategy and a vision for apple</strong>, it started with what incredible benefits can we give the customer, where can we take the customer”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s key tool, according to Donald Norman (1995:155) is “innovation in the field of human interface”. Also noting user experience teams “play a prominent role in product development.”</p>

<p>How can developers focus on user experience? Rogers (2012:2) suggest that Interaction Design (IxD) can help in “developing interactive products that are easy, effective, and pleasurable to use.”</p>

<p>Brown suggests that (2008:1) “thinking like a designer can transform the way you develop products, services, processes - and even strategy.” This bold statement begs the question how do you think like a designer? Dorst &amp; Dijkhuis (1995:262) suggest that design has two strands, engineering and art, they describe</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Two paradigms for describing design activity”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the first is an engineering methodology the second is the same design we find in graphic design.</p>

<p>According to Cooper (2007:xxvii), Interaction Design is focussed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“on something that traditional design disciplines do not often explore: the design of behavior.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked many times (as consultant, employee, lead), does this methodology work? While GDD is no silver bullet, it has proven to be a very effective development tool for many projects - the research and prototype phase is key to successes I have been involved with. <strong>Three tools</strong> in particular stand out from the GDD process:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The U&amp;DA</strong> (User &amp;amp: ): helped me to create stakeholder buy-in, and explain the amount of work I put in to the process. This would bare out Goodwin’s (2011:351) assertion that the U&amp;DA <em>“is an essential part of the design process because it promotes common understanding, shared expectations, and commitment among stakeholders in a way that no other approach can.”</em></p></li>

<li><p>Key path scenarios and storyboards: As Goodwin states (2010:455) these “help you jump across the chasm between understanding users and solving their problems”, they also helped me “to bring others across that gap with you”.
• Personas: the tool by which we turn our raw data into usable models, as Copper cautions (2012:76) “considerable rigour and finesse must be applied to the process”. This was a very time consuming step - between interviews and modelling it took about 170 hours. But the effort was worthwhile. The development team refer to the personas by name. The lead developer says Jenny (the primary persona), is the ‘most for most’ meaning development efforts for Jenny cover most functionality for most users.
GDD is in my experience a very effective set of tools. I can understand why Cooper’s innovations are widely used in industry but what about academia? Blomkvist writes that (2002:1)</p></li>
