         <h1>Virtual Teams and Swift Trust</h1>
         <p>Conclusions
Reality often means that virtual teams will work together and never meet face to face. In these circumstances it is important to note some points:
* Choose the right communication tools for the team. Where face to face meetings are not available other synchronous communications can and do substitute well.
* Set up is key: rules of engagement, agreement on measurable outcome and participation should all be agreed at the outset. Furst et al (2004) suggest <em>“that successful project teams invest time up-front with project managers to deal with the “fuzzy front end” of their projects which are often characterized by an ill-defined purpose, ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities, and the uncertainty of acquiring resources and support.”</em>
* Emergent leaders and swift trust mean that the power structures of virtual teams must be very different than that of face to face teams. Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) state that “as the perceived need for a member to press the others to present ideas arose, a member filled the position. As the need arose for someone to organize the remaining work, a member filled that position.”
* If team leaders are appointed,that leadership should take the role of ‘scrum master’. Furst et al (2004) maintain “Virtual team sponsors must be sensitive to these dual demands and, as needed, be willing to negotiate with local executives the relative importance and time commitment required for successful virtual project team participation.”
* Virtual teams favour self starters. As Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) state “those individuals who perform best in global virtual teams are not likely to be entirely different from individuals who perform best alone: individuals who are action-oriented, who are willing to take initiative on their own, and who are goal-driven.” This would necessitate profiling potential team members before including them in a virtual team.
It is important to have a social interaction within a virtual team, we did this in many of the most successful teams I&rsquo;ve worked on with WatsApp or Slack area where we could post social interaction, without clogging up the main work channel. Furst, Reeves, Rosen and Blackburn (2004) suggest that “more frequent interaction increases opportunities to break the ice, establish lines of communication, and identify points of similarity, all of which are critical for successful team formation.”
In conclusion face to face meetings are an important both to team building and the ongoing success of a team, and where time and money allows, face to face meetings are desirable and useful. But more important to the success of virtual teams than face to face meetings is awareness of the modus and dynamics of virtual teams.</p>
