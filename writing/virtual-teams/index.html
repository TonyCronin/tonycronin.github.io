         <h2>Virtual Teams and Swift Trust</h2>
         

<h4 id="why-some-virtual-team-succeed">Why Some Virtual Team Succeed</h4>

<p>Virtual teams have become an essential part IT work practices. Indeed the idea that a company or organization can develop global reach without developing some degree of virtual team structure is hard to imagine. Professor <a href="https://hbr.org/1995/05/trust-and-the-virtual-organization">Charles Handy</a> (writing in 1995) argued virtuality is an irresistible economic force. Handy wrote that virtual teams are built on trust -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Trust inevitably requires some sense of mutuality, of reciprocal loyalty&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reality often means that virtual teams will work together and never meet face to face. In these circumstances it is important to note some points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Choose the right communication tools</strong> for the team. One company I worked for was limited by poor internal Skype4B setup. Meetings where forever cutting out, failing and audio missing. Poor experience can severely limit the effectiveness of a team. Where face to face meetings are not available other synchronous communications can and do substitute well.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Set up is key:</strong> rules of engagement, agreement on measurable outcome and participation should all be agreed at the outset. Furst (2004) suggests <em>“that successful project teams invest time up-front with project managers to deal with the “fuzzy front end” of their projects which are often characterized by an ill-defined purpose, ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities, and the uncertainty of acquiring resources and support.”</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Swift Trust</strong>, is a phrase coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_trust_theory#Swift_trust_in_global_virtual_teams">Debra Meyerson</a>. She noted that levels of initial trust are observed among members of temporary teams (such as flight crews). Initial high levels of trust are also observed in this highest performing virtual teams.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Emergent leaders and swift trust</strong> mean that the power structures of virtual teams must be very different than that of face to face teams. Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) state that <em>“as the perceived need for a member to press the others to present ideas arose, a member filled the position. As the need arose for someone to organize the remaining work, a member filled that position.”</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>If team leaders are appointed, that leadership should take the role of ‘scrum master’</strong>. Furst (2004) maintain “Virtual team sponsors must be sensitive to these dual demands and, as needed, be willing to negotiate with local executives the relative importance and time commitment required for successful virtual project team participation.”</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Virtual teams favor self starters</strong>. As Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) state “those individuals who perform best in global virtual teams are not likely to be entirely different from individuals who perform best alone: individuals who are action-oriented, who are willing to take initiative on their own, and who are goal-driven.” This would necessitate profiling potential team members before including them in a virtual team.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Allow some downtime</strong> It is important to have a social interaction within a virtual team. Apps such as WatsApp or Slack allow you to post social interaction, without clogging up the main work channel. Furst, Reeves, Rosen and Blackburn (2004) suggest that “more frequent interaction increases opportunities to break the ice, establish lines of communication, and identify points of similarity, all of which are critical for successful team formation.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One final point to note, an initial or ongoing <strong>co-located meeting</strong>, is an important first step both to team building and success of a team, and where time and money allows. But more important to the success of virtual teams is an awareness of the modus and dynamics of virtual teams.</p>
